# Search Bar Implementation - Current Capabilities and Limitations

## What the Current Search Bar Can Do:
- Open and close via keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + K) or Escape key.
- Display a modal search input overlay.
- Accept user input for search queries.
- Store and display recent searches (up to 5), persisted in localStorage.
- Navigate to a search results page with the query parameter on search submission or recent search selection.
- Dynamically update styling (colors, accents) based on the current theme and color scheme preferences.
- Focus the input automatically when the search modal opens.
- Close the modal when clicking outside the search area or pressing Escape.
- Provide accessible UI elements with icons and buttons.

## What the Current Search Bar Cannot Do:
- Perform actual search logic or query against a data source (search functionality is stubbed).
- Display live search suggestions or autocomplete results.
- Handle pagination or filtering of search results.
- Support advanced search features like fuzzy matching, typo tolerance, or ranking.
- Provide accessibility features beyond basic keyboard navigation (e.g., ARIA roles, screen reader announcements).
- Integrate with external search services like Algolia or Elasticsearch.
- Support multi-language or localization in the search UI.
- Provide error handling or feedback for empty or invalid queries.
- Customize search scope or categories.

## Next Steps / Recommendations:
- Implement actual search backend or client-side search logic.
- Add live search suggestions and autocomplete.
- Enhance accessibility features.
- Integrate with external search providers if needed.
- Add localization support.
- Improve UI/UX with loading states, error messages, and empty states.
